README, rout_new.c:
compile: make


You need to make links in the directory where you run the routing model to
"run_moscem_hydro" and "run_moscem_hydro_leapyear" (moscem related files, are
included in the moscem.tar file).


All arcinfo-type input files must have the header included.

Example, Routing input file (329.main):
# 329 #
BASIN_NUMBER    329
FLOW_DIREC_FILE input/329.dir
VELOCITY_FILE   1.5
DIFF_FILE       800
XMASK_FILE      input/329.xmask
FRACTION_FILE   input/329.frac
IRRIGATION      0
ROUTED_FILE     input/329.irrb
RESEROIVRS  1
RESERVOIR_FILE  input/329.reservoirs.firstline
STATION_FILE    input/329.sta
FLUX_PATH       ../output/standard
INPUT_FILE_PATH  ../output/daily.ascii/fluxes_
INPUT_FILE_PREC 2
DEMAND_FILE_PATH /mn/hox/hydro/ingjerd/global/data/dams/reservoir_data
DEMAND          0
OUT_FILE_PATH output/cru/baseline/old/stn_6_1/329.wb.reservoirs/
WORK_PATH output/cru/baseline/old/stn_6_1/329.wb.reservoirs/
NAT_PATH  output/cru/baseline/old/stn_6_1/329.wb/
INPUT_DATES 1960 1 1990 12
OUTPUT_DATES 1960 1 1990 12
UNIT_HYD_FILE   input/uh.file


Explanations:
IRRIGATION: Set to 0
ROUTED_FILE: Use a non-existing filename
RESERVOIRS: Set to 0 for naturalized simulations, 1 when including reservoir operations
RESERVOIR_FILE: includes info on capacity, height of dam etc. See below.
FLUX_PATH: Where binary VIC simulation results are located. Used for finding
reservoir evaporation (at the moment commented out of rout.c ! )
INPUT_FILE_PATH: Daily ascii files, VIC results (see below for format)
DEMAND_FILE_PATH: Not used in this version
DEMAND: Set to 0
OUT_FILE_PATH: Location of routed files.
WORK_PATH: Set to the same as OUT_FILE_PATH 
NAT_PATH: Location of routed files, naturalized conditions.

You must first run the model for naturalized situation, and in this case
OUT_FILE_PATH, WORK_PATH and NAT_PATH should be the location of the output
files. When including reservoirs, set OUT_FILE_PATH and WORK_PATH to another
directory, and NAT_PATH should point to the directory of the naturalized
simulations.

Comparison to the fortran-version of the code:
Changes 1: 
  The routing input file has to be similar to the one above.
  	I.e. list the input files in the same order, and keep 
  	the structure as is.
Changes 2: 
  Two columns are added to the station information file. The second
  	number on the line gives information on whether the station 
  	is already routed (1). If so, it won't be routed again. 
  	If you set the number to 0, the routing
  	program assumes you want to rout the area again. 
  	The right-most column tells the routing program what kind of cell we 
  	are dealing with. 1: Regular cell (nonirrigated part), 2: Dam, 
	3: Irrigated part of cell. 
  NB! NB! NB!
	You must list the stations from upstream to downstream locations!
  NB! NB! NB!   
        Be aware that this causes changes to the .uh_s file!!!!!
Changes 3: For each routed station, a file called 'streamflow_lat_lon' is made.
  It will be located in the 'Output_files' directory. Units m3/s, time step daily.
Changes 4: The output is written to m3/s instead of ft3/s. :). 

New feature 1: Skips days in VIC simulation files that won't be routed.
  i.e. ndays is number of days to be routed, not number of days to 
  be routed + number of simulation days before routing starts, which it used to be.
  NB! This may result in less runoff at the beginning of the routing period (spin-up)!!!!
New feature 2: Areas already routed won't be routed again. I.e. if an upstream 
  station location has been routed during this run, or previously (see 'changes 2').

Stupid 1: If you want to do the routing at a location upstream other gauges, 
 you have to make sure the 'Already routed' column is set to 0 at the downstream 
 location........ 
Stupid 2: The VIC simulation flux files have to be ascii files with the 
 following columns:
 Year Month Day Runoff Baseflow
